In a different timeline, in the year 2080, the world was powered by technological innovation
In this society, innovators, enginieers and scientists created machines capable of providing humans with eveything they wanted
Robot maids, robot chefs, robot friends and other android like creations were very normalized in this society
This industry was very profitable, and led to small start-ups making tens of millions in the span of a few years
However, for some, this was not enough
Some felt like there was a better, more effecient way of making money, of ridding humanity of its responsibilities
Some felt like humans were ineffecient, lacking in intelligence and being too emotionally compromised to follow direct orders
Humans made mistakes, Robots didn't
These powerful people, heads of underground Trans-National corporations decided to form a group of assosiates
These assosiates will work to accomplish thier goal:
A fully automated society, powered by Robots
A paradise where humans will no longer need to work, or at least wont be needed
These associates made a collective: <red>RIDIA
Rockblack Innovative Development Initiative Assembly
These Trans-National corporations will share ideas, collaborate and work together to achiieve thier goals
And better yet, they will be immensly wealthy, and have dominant control over society
Especially the workforce that will be mostly populated by robots, of which RDI control.
However, some did not agree with this.
A different conglomerate, made up of a few influential capitalists, felt like this was unethical, dangerous
And even worse, will cause them to lose their power
They formed a different group: Delta Artificial Life and Intelligence Authorities
Or <yellow>DALIA (because who wants to write that out?)
Both <red>RIDIA and <yellow>DALIA are both incredibly influential and technologically dominant groups
Which is why they are both based in Gallium Canyon, Amarica
In fact, that is where our story begins
